My journey into quantum computing research started in my undergraduate years.
In this period, I was awarded a research grant to study the protection of
qubits via continuous dynamical decoupling and error correction.
As one of the main constraints for the performance of quantum computers is the
presence of noise, these techniques to protect or correct the state of the
qubits are to this day important components of quantum control and quantum
computing.
At the time, my role as an undergraduate was to learn the proposal for
continuous dynamical decoupling developed by the local research group and
identify areas where it could be expanded, preparing the path for my future
master's degree work.
