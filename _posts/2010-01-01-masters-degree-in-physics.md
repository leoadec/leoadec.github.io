My master's degreee focused on the problem of quantum errors and how their
dynamics interacts with quantum gates.
We assumed an agnostic approach towards the quantum platforms and considered
how we could come up with methods to correct quantum errors even when those
errors were being changed by the fact that a simultaneous quantum gate was in
process.
We managed to prove that is possible to deal with quantum errors that it is in
principle possible to deal with any kinds of quantum gate error as long as
we're capable of correcting the errors as they happen.

This work was presented as part of an international conference, and later
published in a paper.
I also used it as a starting point for my PhD research into the effects of
quantum measurements in the protection of quantum states, as the general
principle of observing a state constantly to avoid the emergence of new
kinds of errors is still the same.

During this period I also contributed to a study on the protective power
of a measurement that is performed at the same time as bosonic noise is
affecting a qubit.
I was responsible for developing the algorithm for the numerical simulation
of the problem, and implementing it in C.
